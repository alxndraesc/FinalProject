	<p>Traveling is known as moving or going from one place to another. It has various reasons, such as to travel for pleasure, which could be just a trip, or to travel for business. Traveling can be done by foot, bicycle, airplane, bus, or any other means. It's often considered either a hobby, a stress reliever, or a leisure habit by some people that will make them feel satisfied and relieved after a stressful day.</p>
